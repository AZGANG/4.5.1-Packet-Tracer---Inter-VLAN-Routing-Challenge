Assign IP addressing to R1 and S1 based on the Addressing Table.

this will take a while so ill put you on hold..

int g0/0
ip address 172.17.25.2 255.255.255.252
no shutdown 

int g0/1 
no shutdown 

int g0/1.10
encapsulation dot1q 10 
ip address 172.17.10.1 255.255.255.0
no shut 

int g0/1.20 
encapsulation dot1q 20 
ip address 172.17.20.1 255.255.255.0
no shut 

int g0/1.30
encapsulation dot1q 30 
ip address 172.17.30.1 255.255.255.0
no shut

int g0/1.88
encapsulation dot1q 88
ip address 172.17.88.1 255.255.255.0
no shut

int g0/1.99
encapsulation dot1q 99 
ip address 172.17.99.1 255.255.255.0

Create, name, and assign VLANs on S1 based on the VLAN and Port Assignments Table. Ports should be in access mode. Your VLAN names should match the names in the table exactly. this will take time>>>

switch 1 
en 
config t
vlan 10 
name Faculty/Staff

vlan 20 
name Students 

vlan 30 
name Guest(Default)

vlan 88 
name Native 

vlan 99 
name Management

int range f0/11-17 
switchport mode access 
switchport access vlan 10 

int range f0/18 -24 
switchport mode access 
switchport access vlan 20 

int range f0/6 -10 
switchport mode access 
switchport access vlan 30 

Configure G0/1 of S1 as a static trunk and assign the native VLAN.
int g0/1
switchport mode trunk 
switchport trunk native vlan 99
